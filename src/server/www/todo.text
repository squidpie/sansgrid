Errors/Issues
- Currently the server is purely event-driven, hence there's no way to schedule
  tasks. This is a notable problem including the following areas:

  - After eyeballing, if we're waiting for mating permissions from the user, 
    we have no solid way to time that out.

To Do

- Prevent multiple sends if refreshing router page after an add

- Installer needs to create at least one user: the admin (should I prompt for
  a password?).

- Need to write some sort of log maintainence function to be run during returnLogTable();


For SansGrid 2+

- Test for blank fields and react appropriately to increase robustness.
